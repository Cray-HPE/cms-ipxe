# This microservice is intended to be a dynamic ipxe building service. The
# purpose of this service is to respond to changes in the requested ipxe build
# environment and dynamically generate ipxe binaries used for booting.

# The most common form of this building environment is in support of https
# for downloading ipxe binaries from a secure location. The ipxe binaries
# themselves need to be dynamically recreated whenever the public CA cert
# changes.
